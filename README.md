# A RECURSIVE HIGHER-ORDER NON-LINEAR ADAPTIVE WIENER FILTER FOR TIME SERIES SMOOTHING

Often, in the analysis of time series and digital signals, a smoothing procedure is required to filter undesired random perturbations as noise and outliers in data. Among the most widely known techniques for time series smoothing, we have convolutional filters, exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters method) and linear adaptive filters, such as the Wiener filter. In this paper, we propose the NoLAW (Non-Linear Adaptive Wiener filter) algorithm, a recursive higher-order non-linear adaptive Wiener filter, that assumes the hypothesis that the underlying series is corrupted by a zero mean, additive and independent Gaussian noise. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is a computationally efficient and viable approach for filtering time series. Quantitative metrics show that the NoLAW filter is capable of producing better results than Gaussian smoothing, the usual linear Wiener filtering and the Holt-Winters method in several real time series. Moreover, the computational cost of the proposed NoLAW filter is linear in the number of samples, making it asymptotically equivalent to regular Wiener filtering. The gain in performance associated with no significant increase in the computational cost make the NoLAW filter a promising alternative in time series analysis.
